# Spam SMS Detection AI Model

## Overview
This project uses machine learning and NLP techniques to classify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**, automating spam detection for improved communication filtering.

## Dataset
- Contains SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.
- Features: SMS text and label.

## Objectives
- Preprocess text data (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).
- Extract features using TF-IDF or Count Vectorization.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models.

## Technologies
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, nltk

## Implementation
1. Preprocess SMS text (clean, tokenize, normalize).
2. Extract numerical features using TF-IDF.
3. Train models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM).
4. Evaluate models with accuracy and F1-score.

## Results
- **Best Model**: Multinomial Naive Bayes with 98% accuracy.
- Accurate spam detection with high precision and recall.
